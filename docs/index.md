# ReadStore Basic

The Lean Solution for Managing NGS and Omics Data
<br>
<br>

ReadStore is a platform for storing, managing, and integrating omics data. It speeds up analysis and offers a simple way of managing and sharing NGS omics datasets, metadata and processed data (Processed Data). Built-in project and metadata management structures your workflows and a collaborative user interface enhances teamwork â€” so you can focus on generating insights.

The integrated API enables you to directly retrieve data from ReadStore via the terminal Command-Line Interface (CLI) or Python / R SDKs.

The ReadStore Basic version offers a local web server with simple user management. If you need organization-wide deployment, advanced user and group management, or cloud integration, please check the ReadStore Advanced versions and reach out to <a href="mailto:info@evo-byte.com">info@evo-byte.com</a>.
